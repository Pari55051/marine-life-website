                <h2>Jellyfish</h2>
                <p>Jellyfish are the medusa-phase of certain
                    gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum
                    Cnidaria. They are mainly free-swimming marine animals,but a few are
                    anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being motile. They are made of an
                    umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the bell, and a collection of
                    trailing tentacles on the underside. Via pulsating contractions, the bell can provide
                    propulsion for locomotion through open water. The tentacles are armed with stinging
                    cells and may be used to capture prey or to defend against predators.</p>

                <h2>Shark</h2>
                <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch cartilaginous fish characterized by a ribless 
                    endoskeleton, dermal denticles, five to seven gill slits on each side, and pectoral 
                    fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the division 
                    Selachii and are the sister group to the Batomorphi. Some sources extend the term 
                    "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes with a 
                    shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as 
                    Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419-359 million years), 
                    though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician 
                    (458-444 million years ago).</p>

                <h2>Clownfish</h2>
                <p>Clownfishes or anemonefishes are saltwater fishes in the genus Amphiprion within the 
                    subfamily Amphiprioninae. They are classified as damselfish within the family 
                    Pomacentridae. Clownfishes are found in the warm and tropical waters of the 
                    Indo-Pacific, inhabiting mainly coral reefs. They have a distinctive colouration 
                    typically consisting of white vertical bars on a red, orange, yellow, brown or black 
                    background. Clownfish developed a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, 
                    which they rely on for shelter and protection from predators. In turn, clownfish will 
                    protect the anemone from anemone-eating fish, as well as clean and fan them, and 
                    attract photosynthetic zooxanthellae with their waste.</p>
