        <h1 class="title">Marine Life</h1>

        <p class="intro-text">Marine life, also known as sea life or ocean life, refers to the vast array of organisms that inhabit the world's oceans and seas. These organisms range from microscopic plankton to the largest animals on Earth, such as the blue whale. Marine ecosystems are incredibly diverse and play a critical role in maintaining the health of the planet.</p>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and support millions of species, many of which remain undiscovered. Marine organisms contribute to global processes like oxygen production, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling. They also provide food, medicine, and livelihoods for billions of people worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Habitats</h2>
            <p>Different marine species live in a wide variety of ocean environments. Each habitat supports its own unique community of organisms adapted to specific conditions like depth, temperature, and light availability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coral Reefs</strong>: Warm, shallow waters with high biodiversity; often called the "rainforests of the sea."</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Sea</strong>: Cold, dark areas below 200 meters; home to species that can survive high pressure and low light.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Areas</strong>: Includes estuaries, mangroves, and tidal zones that act as nurseries for many marine species.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Ocean</strong>: The largest and least explored habitat, home to migratory species like tuna and whales.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Major Groups of Marine Organisms</h2>
            <p>Marine life includes a wide range of species that vary in size, structure, and ecological roles. The main groups include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fish</strong>: Vertebrates that live in water and use gills to extract oxygen. They are the most diverse group of marine animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Marine Mammals</strong>: Warm-blooded animals like whales, dolphins, and seals that breathe air and often live in family groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Invertebrates</strong>: Animals without backbones, such as jellyfish, octopuses, crabs, and sea stars.</li>
                <li><strong>Marine Plants and Algae</strong>: Include seaweeds, seagrasses, and microscopic phytoplankton that perform photosynthesis.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Importance of Marine Life</h2>
            <p>Marine life is essential to the health of the Earth’s ecosystem. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide and produce over half of the planet’s oxygen through the activity of marine plants and plankton. Marine ecosystems also regulate weather patterns, support global trade routes, and offer recreational and cultural value.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Threats to Marine Life</h2>
            <p>Human activities are causing significant harm to marine ecosystems. If left unaddressed, these threats could lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems and loss of species.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pollution</strong>: Includes plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical runoff from land-based sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Overfishing</strong>: The removal of fish from the ocean at rates faster than they can reproduce.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Leads to rising ocean temperatures, acidification, and the melting of polar ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Habitat Destruction</strong>: Coastal development, trawling, and coral reef damage reduce natural habitats.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>Efforts to protect marine life include international laws, marine protected areas (MPAs), and sustainable fishing practices. Organizations and governments work together to monitor ocean health, reduce pollution, and raise awareness about marine conservation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <p class="outro-text">Everyone can contribute by reducing plastic use, supporting sustainable seafood, and learning more about the importance of ocean life.</p>
