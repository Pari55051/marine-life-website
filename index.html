        <h1 class="title">Marine Life</h1>

        <p class="intro-text">Many organisms inahbit the ocean which covers our earth. They are collectively known as Marine Life. Marine life consists of organisms ranging from smallest of the bacterias to the largest mammal on earth. The ocean and the organisms living in it constitute the Marine Ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in the earth's complete ecosystem and helps keep our planet healthy.</p>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface. They support millions of species in which many of them are still undiscovered. Marine organisms play an important role in processes like oxygen production, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling. They also provide food, medicine, and livelihoods for billions of people worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Habitats</h2>
            <p>Marine animals live in a wide variety of ocean environments. Each habitat has its own unique features like depth, water temperature and amount of light that reaches from the sun to the habitat. Some habitats and their features are as folows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coral Reefs</strong>: Warm, shallow water. Many organisms thive in such an environment and thus the name "Rainforests of the Ocean"</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Sea</strong>: Cold, dark areas below 200 meters. Only a few species who can survive such conditions live here</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Areas</strong>: Includes estuaries, mangroves, and tidal zones. These provide shelter and food for many marine organisms</li>
                <li><strong>Open Ocean</strong>: Largest and least explored. Generally, migrating secias like tuna and whales are found here</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Major Groups of Marine Organisms</h2>
            <p>Marine life includes a wide range of species. They vary in size, structure, and their role in the ecosystem. The main groups include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fish</strong>:They are the most diverse group of marine animals. Are vertebrates and use gills to breathe under water.</li>
                <li><strong>Marine Mammals</strong>: Some warm-blooded animals like Whale, Dolphins, etc. live in groups and frequently come upto the surface to breathe. </li>
                <li><strong>Invertebrates</strong>: Species like jellysih, octopus, etc. i.e the ones which do not have a backbone</li>
                <li><strong>Marine Plants and Algae</strong>: A variety of plants like seaweeds, seagrasses and corals thrive under water</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Importance of Marine Life</h2>
            <p>Marine life is essential to the health of the Earth's ecosystem. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide and produce over half of the planet's oxygen through the activity of marine plants and planktons. Marine ecosystems also regulate weather patterns, support global trade routes, and offer recreational and cultural value.</p>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Threats to Marine Life</h2>
            <p>Human activities are causing a lot of harm to marine ecosystems. If left unaddressed, these threats could lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems and loss of species. Some activites directly harming the oceans are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pollution</strong>: Waste dumped into the oceans, especially plastic waste, un-treated chemicals, oil-spills,etc. cause direct harm to the ecosystem</li>
                <li><strong>Overfishing</strong>: Fish species are being depleted due to fishing more than required and faster than the species can reproduce</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Rise in ocean temperature, meltig of polar ice,etc. are caused by climate change which harm the oceans</li>
                <li><strong>Habitat Destruction</strong>: Coastal development, trawling, and coral reef damage harm natural habitats of the marine life</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-div">
            <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>Some measures are being taken to protect marine life such as making international laws, declaring Marine Protected Areas(MPAs), promoting sustainable fishing practices,etc. Many organizations, government or independent, work to monitor ocean health and raise awareness about marine conservation. Everyone can contribute by reducing plastic use, supporting sustainable seafood, and following good environmental practices.</p>
